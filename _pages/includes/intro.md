# 🐑 About Me
I was a research assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/). I received the Ph.D. from Sichuan University (四川大学) in 2025, advised by [Yi Zhang(张意)](http://deepimaging.group/). From 2024 to 2025, I was a research intern at A*STAR, advised by [Joey Tianyi Zhou](https://joeyzhouty.github.io/). I have published over 20 first-authored papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2vZsJskAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FZi-YuanYang%2Fzi-yuanyang.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>
in top-tier journals and conferences, including IJCV, IEEE T-IFS, IEEE T-NNLS, IEEE T-SMCS, IEEE T-AI, IEEE J-BHI, PR, CVPR, AAAI, and others. One paper is selected as ESI highly cited paper. Additionally, I have served as a reviewer for several prestigious journals and conferences, such as IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-IP, IEEE T-IFS, IEEE T-DSC, IEEE T-MI, IEEE T-MM, IEEE T-NNLS, CVPR, ICCV, and MICCAI, among others.

<!-- I am now a final-year Ph.D. student at Sichuan University (四川大学), advised by [Yi Zhang(张意)](http://deepimaging.group/).  I'm also a visiting student at A*Star, Singapore.

I am now working on audio-driven talking face generation, text-to-speech and music generation research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ren.yi@bytedance.com](mailto:ren.yi@bytedance.com). We are hiring interns!

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (谭旭)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (秦涛)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee. -->
